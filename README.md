# python-twitch-irc
`twitch_irc` is a layer of logic which takes the [Pydle] package and provides (or modifies existing) logic to handle Twitch IRC pecularities.

## Installation
`twitch_irc` can be installed via `pip install twitch_irc`

## Usage
`twitch_irc` is a layer which sits above `Pydle` so if documentation is lacking, refer to `Pydle` documentation.  Twitch IRC is not fully compliant with RFC1459 and later, so some behaviors may not function as expected (such as who/whois, nick, etc).

### Twitch
Utilizing this library requires a Twitch account and a token generated for that account.  A token can be generated via [TwitchApps].  Note that the generated token has the prefix 'oauth' which should be removed before use.

#### Rate Limiting
`TwitchIrc` does not provide rate limiting.  To see rates and limits, see [Twitch Irc Guide].

### Basic Usage
`TwitchIrc` is expected to be used as a base class.
```python
from twitch_irc import TwitchIrc

# Simple echo bot.
class MyOwnBot(TwitchIrc):
    def on_connect(self):
         self.join('#best_streamer')

    # Override from base class
    def on_message(self, timestamp, tags, channel, user, message):
        self.message(channel, message)

client = MyOwnBot('MyBot', 'MyTwitchOAuthToken').start()
client.handle_forever()
```
### Pydle IRC Functionality
Most of the Basic IRC functionality can be found via [Pydle Documentation].  It shold be noted that not all functionality provided by `Pydle` is compatible with Twitch IRC.

### Twitch IRC Callbacks
`TwitchIRC` provides callbacks which can be overriden.  Their purpose/meaning can be divined from [Twitch Irc Guide].
```python
def on_cleared_chat(self, timestamp, tags, channel):
    pass

def on_channel_ban(self, timestamp, tags, channel, user):
    pass

def on_hosting(self, timestamp, host, hostee, viewers):
    pass

def on_stop_hosting(self, timestamp, host, viewers):
    pass

def on_notice(self, timestamp, tags, channel, message):
    pass

def on_reconnect_cmd(self, timestamp):
    pass

def on_roomstate(self, timestamp, tags, channel):
    pass

def on_usernotice(self, timestamp, tags, channel, message):
    pass

def on_userstate(self, timestamp, tags, channel):
    pass

def on_whisper(self, timestamp, tags, user, message):
    pass

def on_message(self, timestamp, tags, channel, user, message):
    pass
```

### Capabilities
By default, capabilities are enabled.  To disable capabilities, override the following functions and return `False`:
``` python
def on_capability_twitch_tv_membership_available(self, value):
def on_capability_twitch_tv_tags_available(self, value):
def on_capability_twitch_tv_commands_available(self, value):
```
## Development
Development environment utilizes `docker` and `docker-compose` for building and testing the library.
### Building
The `twitch_irc` library can be build via `./build.sh`
### Testing
The unit tests can be run via `./test.sh`.  Local changes can be tested without rebuilding the test container via `./test-dev.sh` but requires that the initial test container be built.
